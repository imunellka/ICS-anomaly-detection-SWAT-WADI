Expensiveness in the construction and the maintenance of Physical testbeds are the first barriers a research group will encounter when deciding to build one. Suppose a research group can deal with this limitation. In that case, it is useful to share with the community datasets collected from the Physical testbed and the related documentation, as iTrust laboratory of SUTD is doing with SWaT and WADI.

The most widely known and reputable of these are the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) testbed and water distribution testbed (WADI), both of which were implemented and deployed at iTrust.
